### Features
#### 1.Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
* Importing necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scipy, and matplotlib.  

* Loading the dataset.  

* Exploring data distribution, missing values, and outliers.  

* Visualizing data using plots and statistical summaries.  

#### 2.Feature Engineering:
* Handling missing values.  

* Encoding categorical variables.  

* Scaling numerical features (e.g., using MinMaxScaler).  

#### 3.Model Building and Evaluation:
* Implementing a logistic regression model (LogisticRegression).  

* Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.  

* Creating ROC curves and precision-recall curves.  

* Assessing model robustness with cross-validation.
  
#### 4.Dealing with Imbalanced Data:
* Using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.  

* Addressing class imbalance for better model performance.
